# My programs

This repository consists of multiple programs that I have written in the Python programming language. A description of each program is 
given in the docstring (the sentences enclosed within the triple quotes) of every file. Alternatively, see the README.txt file in the folder of each program. I am also fluent in the Java programming language. For any queries, contact me on Quora @ https://www.quora.com/profile/Maruth-Goyal

Happy reading!
