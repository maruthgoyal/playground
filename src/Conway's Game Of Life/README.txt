This program plays a simple game of Conway's Game Of Life in a 5x5 grid.

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
